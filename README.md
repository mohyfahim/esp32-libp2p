# ESP32-Libp2p  

This project aims to support [this library](https://github.com/libp2p/cpp-libp2p/) for ESP-IDF platform. Maybe All other platforms with `lwip`!?


This is a WIP, some works need to be done as follows:

- change the boost tcp with lwip 
- use sqlite in esp32 instead of default sqlite
- remove redundant libraries ?
